Reactive Genetics is a web portal. Individuals who have either paid to have their genes sequenced, or done it themselves (an increasing probability in coming years), can paste in their sequence into the home page of the web portal. It then returns another web page telling them whether they hold a "good" or "bad" gene for one of six common markers of genetic disease.
